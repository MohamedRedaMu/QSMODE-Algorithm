# QSMODE-Algorithm
ðŸ§  **Q-Spline Multi-Operator Differential Evolution (QSMODE)** - A novel optimization algorithm integrating reinforcement learning (Q-learning) with metaheuristic optimization for path planning.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
QSMODE is designed to:
- Enhance **path-planning efficiency** in ADS with **faster convergence** and **learning-based adaptability**.
- Improve solution **smoothness, consistency, and obstacle avoidance**.
- Extend **DXMODE** with **reinforcement learning** (Q-learning) for path planning.
